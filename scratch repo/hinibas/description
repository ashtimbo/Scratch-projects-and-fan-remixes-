I don't think anyone cares about this which makes me and AsherThom sad this is so sad Apperture tell alexa to play james charles pacito

I think this because it's an adult website so kids aren't gonna use it and also I think all websites should be allowed if there is no personal info on it. Mah boi @AsherThom got banned for referencing twitter on his about me which I think is a little extreme (also he called a kid a noob (he said jk afterwards) because they were being annoying). So yeah I see nothing wrong with twitter. Discord? Makes sense to ban someone for that. Twitter? no. Kids aren't gonna get led in by pedos or anything because I'm pretty sure most kids have parents which wouldn't let their 9yo go on twitter and if he kid didn't then they would be in an adoption centre or something and they would be protected if they were using a computer so yeah
